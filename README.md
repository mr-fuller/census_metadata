# census_metadata

I really like how the [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi) and [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) packages for R have functions for retrieving metadata, and I saw that the [census](https://github.com/datamade/census) package for python didn't have anything like that, so I am attempting to build it myself.


Currently working for:
- 5-year ACS from 2009-2016
- 1-year ACS from 2012-2016
- Summary File 1 from 1990-2010 Decennial Census
- Summary File 3 from 1990-2000 Decennial Census
