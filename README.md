Get Metadata from Census API: currently working for 5-year acs from 2009-2016

I really like how in the [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi) package for R has functions for retrieving metadata, and I saw that 
the [census](https://github.com/datamade/census) package for python didn't have anything like that, so I am attempting to build it myself.
